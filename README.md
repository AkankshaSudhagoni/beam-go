# beam-go

 first check the version
 commands we willÂ need to work with Go.

 We can get to version 1 by using first command.

my final product is "go1.18 Windows/AMD version "

What we're doing here is utilizing the second command to get apache beam and the third command to get the wordcount, and then using the fourth command to generate the output file with the word count.

```
1.go version
2.go get -u github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/pkg/beam
3.go install github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/examples/wordcount
4..\wordcount --input sample.txt --output akankshaoutput 
5. Get-Content akankshaoutput 
```
